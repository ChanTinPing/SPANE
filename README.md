# SPANE: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Dynamic VM Scheduling

This code is based on the paper "Symmetry-Preserving Architecture for Multi-NUMA Environments (SPANE): A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Dynamic VM Scheduling." It is a modified version of [VMAgent](https://github.com/mail-ecnu/VMAgent), which is a platform for applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Virtual Machine (VM) scheduling tasks. VMAgent was developed by the Multi-Agent Artificial Intelligence Lab (MAIL) at East China Normal University and the Algorithm Innovation Lab at HUAWEI Cloud.

Due to time constraints, the currently available code has not been fully organized, and it cannot run properly. We will reorganize and provide the complete code, along with full instructions, by February 20.
